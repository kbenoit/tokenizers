Computational text analysis usually proceeds according to a series of 
well-defined steps. After importing texts, the usual next step is to turn the 
human-readable text into machine-readable tokens. Tokens are defined as 
segments of a text identified as meaningful units for the purpose of analyzing 
the text. They may consist of individual words or of larger or smaller 
segments, such as word sequences, word subsequences, paragraphs, sentences, or 
lines [@Manningetal2008, 22]. Tokenization is the process of splitting the text 
into these smaller pieces, and it often involves preprocessing the text to 
remove punctuation and transform all tokens into lowercase [@welbers_text_2017, 
250-251]. Decisions made during tokenization have a significant effect on 
subsequent analysis [@denny_text_forthcoming; @guthrie_closer_2006]. Especially 
for large corpora, tokenization can be computationally expensive, and 
tokenization is highly language dependent.  Efficiency and correctness are 
therefore paramount concerns for tokenization.

The [tokenizers](http://lincolnmullen.com/software/tokenizers/) package for 
R provides fast, consistent tokenization for natural language text 
[@tokenizers; @rbase]. (The package is available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers) and archived on 
[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1205017).) Each of the tokenizers 
expects a consistent input and returns a consistent output, so that the 
tokenizers can be used interchangeably with one another or relied on in other 
packages. To ensure the correctness of output, the package depends on the 
stringi package, which implements Unicode support for R [@gagolewski_2018]. 
To ensure the speed of tokenization, key components such as the _n_-gram and 
skip _n_-gram tokenizers are written using the Rcpp package 
[@eddelbuettel_2013; @eddelbuettel_2017]. The tokenizers package is part of 
the [rOpenSci project](https://ropensci.org/).

The most important tokenizers in the current version of the package can be 
grouped as follows:

- tokenizers for characters and shingled characters
- tokenizers for words and word stems, as well as for Penn Treebank tokens 
- tokenizers _n_-grams and skip _n_-grams
- tokenizers for tweets, which preserve formatting of usernames and hashtags

In addition the package provides functions for splitting longer documents into 
sentences and paragraphs, or for splitting a long text into smaller chunks each 
with the same number of words. This allows users to treat parts of very long 
texts as documents in their own right. The package also provides functions for 
counting words, characters, and sentences.

The tokenizers in this package can be used on their own, or they can be wrapped 
by higher-level R packages. For instance, the tokenizers package is a 
dependency for the tidytext [@silge_2016], text2vec [@selivanov_2018], 
and textreuse [@mullen_2016] packages. More broadly, the output of the 
tokenization functions follows the guidelines set by the text-interchange 
format  defined at an rOpenSci Text Workshop in 2017 [@tif_2017]. Other 
packages which buy into the text-interchange format can thus use the 
tokenizers package interchangeably.

The tokenizers package has research applications in any discipline which 
uses computational text analysis. The package was originally created for  
historical research into the use of the Bible in American newspapers 
[@mullen_americas] and into the borrowing of legal codes of civil procedure in 
the nineteenth-century United States [@funkmullen_spine_2018, 
@funkmullen_servile_2016]. The tokenizers package underlies the tidytext 
package [@silge_text_2017], and via that package tokenizers has been used 
in disciplines such as political science [@sanger_2015_], social science 
[@warin_mapping], communication studies [@xu_using_2018], English 
[@ballier_rbased_2017], and the digital humanities more generally.
